    "# HTML Report Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple generator developed for reporting results from (large-scale) experimental studies in a form of a sortable table. The generator receives a json file describing experimental results to be displayed; thus column headers and contents can be designed and tailored to individual experiments. It supports 2D images, videos, and quantitative measurements. The format of json file compatible with the generator is described below. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "The generator was developed using [python 3.6.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pandas 0.23.0](https://pandas.pydata.org/) to generate an html table. For conda users, you can install the packages using a\n",
    "command\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install python=3.6.5 pandas=0.23.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "or create a new conda environment using .yml files provided in `./enviroments/` using a command\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "Currently only a yml file for Windows is provided and that for Linux will be added soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON format\n",
    "\n",
    "A json file is used as an input to describe the format of your desired HTML table and paths to experimental results to be displayed. The generator supports quantitative measurements and media (i.e., 2D images and videos). Here we assume that your quantitative measurements are stored in one .csv file on which each column represents each metric measure separated by a comma (,). **An extra column with the pre-defined, fixed header `measure_uid` need to be present**; each element in this column is an **ID of each experiment**, implying that all related images and/or videos resulted from the experiment shared the same ID. `measure_uid` is used internally as a key to link each measurement to each relevant media to be displayed in the same row of the HTML table. An example of a csv file reporting target registration error, normalized cross correlation, and Jacobian determinants of displacement fields is\n",

    "1223327,0.432,0.789,3.976\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "The json file contains two `name/value` pairs: <br/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"experiment_title\":\"your experiment name\"\n",
    "\"measurements\":\"path/to/csv-file\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The latter is the csv file described above. Aside from these two pairs, the json file contains any number of `name/object` pairs. An `object` in each `name/object` pair describe media involving with each experiment and the `name` is just an arbitrary ID for the result. An example result from the 0-th rigid registration could be <br/>\n",
